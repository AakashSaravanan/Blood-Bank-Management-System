The code is a Python script designed to interact with a MySQL database for managing a blood bank system. It allows users to perform various operations such as listing blood donors,
listing blood stock, deleting blood donors aged over 70, and deleting blood stock aged over 70.

1. The script establishes a connection to a MySQL database named "BLOODBANK".
2. It defines functions for different operations such as managing blood donors (dono()), managing blood stock (stock()), listing all blood donors (donoall()), listing all blood stock
   (stockall()), deleting blood donors aged over 70 (deldono()), and deleting blood stock aged over 70 (delstock()).
3. The main() function serves as the entry point of the program, displaying options for the user to choose from.
4. User input is validated to ensure it matches the available choices.
5. Error handling is implemented using try and except blocks to manage exceptions that may occur during database operations.

Overall, the program aims to provide a simple interface for managing blood bank data stored in a MySQL database.
